# Individual Project 

This project was completed on Jupyter notebook using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to answer the research question of: do chain restaurants in Raleigh, NC receive higher health inspection scores on average than independent restaurants? How does the number of critical and non-critical violations affect these scores?

The dataset used in the analysis was provided by the course instructor.
